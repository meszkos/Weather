# Weather

App makes API call, then displays weather data using CollectionView embeded in TableView

App is written in UIKit

I completed all tasks but I realise it can be done better.
1. I struggled the most with populating table view rows with data from API and despite my code does what it should, it would be hard to allow user to add cities by himself. Also my app was reading data in kind of random order like [London, Barcelona, Paris] and then [Barcelona, Paris, London]. That’s why I added first,second and third forecast so that city names are dynamic and data is correct no matter the orders
2. I can’t find reason why sometimes when I run the app on simulator or physical device, when scrolling collection views images are sort of vibrating
